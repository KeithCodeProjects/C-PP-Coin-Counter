# C-PP-Coin-Counter

* This C++ program sorts different types of U.S. coins based on diameter and weight of each type of coin and a +-2% acceptable wear tolerance
* for each type of coin. It calculates and displays the acceptable high and low tolerances for diameter and weight for each type of 
* coin.  It then opens a text file containing diameters and weights of each coin, reads the data and determines if it is a 
* valid coin and what type of coin it is.  It counts the number of each type of coin contained in a text file and also calculates the total
* value of each type of coins outputting the results.  It also outputs the number of invalid coins contained in the file that do not
* have acceptable diameters and weights to be classified as any one of the types of coins.
